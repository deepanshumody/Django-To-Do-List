# Django_To_Do
A simple todolist app using Django and React
GTD: Container/stub site for django-todo
Django-todo is a reusable app that can be plugged into any running Django project. If you don't have a handy Django project to plug it into, or just want a quick starter site to try django-todo in, this project is the reference / example host site used by the author (though you might find it handy as a generic Django starter site for other purposes as well).

Installation
clone the repository and use pipenv to create the virtual environment and install the dependencies. The instructions below assume you are using sqlite as your database, ~/dev as your development directory, and pipenv as your environment manager. Modify as needed.

pip3 install --user git+https://github.com/pypa/pipenv.git
cd ~/dev
git clone git@github.com:shacker/gtd.git
cd gtd
pipenv --python 3.6   # Initializes the virtual environment
pipenv install --dev  # Installs all dependencies
pipenv shell  # Activates the environment
Copy local.example.py to local.py and modify to match your local db credentials. In local.py:

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
    }
}
Then:

./manage.py migrate

See additional instructions in the django-todo README.
